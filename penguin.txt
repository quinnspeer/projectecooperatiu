Round 2

Hi James, at least some peace...!!

The examen went normal, not too easy, not too difficult. we'll see how it goes. I wrote an essay about traveling and a review about The Terminator film, having chosen the computer based examen was a good choice.

  I will let you know once I get my marks July 1st.

Thanks for all!
